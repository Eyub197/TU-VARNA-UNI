// maybe create one function for printing
// for the function that displays the contestants with the youngest ages you can make it so that it counts how many of
// them are in there and then it say "s" if needed and maybe something like "There are x amount of people with this age"
// print the score with the contestant for the winning function
// think about should the showing of cateogry 4 message if there is nobody in the categorry
// eventually add check for maximum int number
// optin I don't want to tell
// you can add age it too high or low
// you add X number too much the maximum we can do is Z
// think obout that maybe you don't need the optional argument for the printContestants function you can do it in the checkContestantsEmpty and have like optional string for more info
// or maybe in printContestant you have place for optional text like "Those are the All of the contestants" "this is the contestants with the youngest ages"
// maybe add the cin.ignore() in the beggining of the setValidName function
// why is it with pointer isValidName
